I realized that Metaflow and Altair are not flexible enough.

- [metaflow graph constraints in creation](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues/67)
- [mlflow stop server functionality required (kill -9 commands not great)](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/1856)
- [create an issue on altair github for angle encoding for mark_text()](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55991996/altair-rotate-text-by-value-specified-in-feature?rq=3)
- [top "center" legend position not available](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68624885/position-altair-legend-top-center)
