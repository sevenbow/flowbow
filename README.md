# FlowBow

A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for MLOps. It is based on the [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science) template.\


###  Requirements:
``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter-data-science
```

### To start a new project, run:

```bash
ccds https://github.com/sevenbow/flowbow
```

cd into the folder and run `bash init.sh` command to run the init.sh file which will install packages in the virtual environment
